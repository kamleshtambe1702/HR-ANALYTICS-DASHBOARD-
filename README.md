🚀 Excited to share my latest project on LinkedIn! 📊

Thrilled to unveil the HR Analytics Dashboard that I've been working on, shedding light on a crucial aspect for businesses - employee attrition. 📉 Through meticulous analysis and data-driven insights, we've delved deep into the factors contributing to attrition and have some fascinating findings to share!

🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Developing and tracking meaningful KPIs has been instrumental in understanding employee attrition trends. From turnover rates to tenure analysis, our dashboard provides a comprehensive view.

📈 Charts & Visualization: Visual representation of data is key to understanding complex patterns. Our dashboard boasts visually appealing charts and graphs that help in quick comprehension of insights, making data-driven decisions a breeze.

📖 Storytelling from Raw Data: Transforming raw data into actionable insights is an art, and storytelling is the language we use to convey our findings effectively. From identifying attrition hotspots to predicting future trends, our storytelling approach brings the data to life.

💡 Insights & Conclusion: Perhaps the most compelling aspect of our project is the conclusion we've drawn from the data. Through rigorous analysis, we've found that attrition often correlates with employees feeling undervalued due to compensation misalignment. Specifically, our analysis indicates that offering a CTC below the average market salary significantly contributes to attrition rates.

🙏 A Special Thanks: None of this would have been possible without the invaluable guidance and support of Rishabh Mishra Sir. Your mentorship has been instrumental in shaping this project and unlocking insights that drive meaningful change.
